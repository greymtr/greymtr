hey;
i'm greymtr.

i enjoy writing code, and am constantly growing my expertise in borderline esoteric skills and technologies.

i use the shell a lot, i know a bunch of mainstream programming languages - c, java and python; though nowadays i spend a considerable amount of time trying to learn scheme and switch over to languages that will allow me to better explore the functional programming paradigm, which i'm very interested in.

i'm a linux user and a vi novice. i personally believe that software should be sustainable - robust, fast, secure and easy to maintain while being mindful of resources utilized and minimizing overall complexity; being able to inspect, modify and redistribute source code is a basic prerequisite for this.

i no longer use github as a source forge and have switched over to the considerably more superior sourcehut \[ sr.ht \] for now. 

i primarily use github as a tool for discovering and noting down projects of interest that align with, or are adjacent to my many interests; check out the \[ somewhat extensive \] list of projects i have starred !
